# Slot Machine Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the **statistical analysis of slot machine games**. The goal is to simulate and analyze the behavior of a slot machine, visualize its outcomes, and provide insights into its probabilities, patterns, and randomness. The project uses **Python** and **OpenCV** for graphical simulations and visualizations.

## Features

- **Graphical Simulation**: 
  - A roulette-like animation highlights different rectangles representing slot machine outcomes.
  - Transparency effects are applied to enhance the visual experience.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Tracks and analyzes the frequency of outcomes.
  - Calculates probabilities and expected values for different results.

- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Number of spins.
  - Speed of the roulette animation.
  - Rectangles representing different outcomes.

- **Visualization**:
  - Displays the slot machine's graphical interface.
  - Highlights outcomes dynamically during the simulation.

## How It Works

.........

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Nobody-1321/SlotStats.git
   cd SlotStats
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. Observe the roulette animation and the highlighted rectangles.

3. Modify the parameters in the script to customize the simulation:
   - `vueltas`: Number of spins.
   - `velocidad`: Speed of the animation.
   - `points`: Coordinates of the rectangles.

## Future Enhancements

- **Outcome Logging**:
  - Record the results of each spin for statistical analysis.

- **Probability Calculation**:
  - Calculate the probability of each outcome based on historical data.

- **Graphical Enhancements**:
  - Add more visual effects to improve the user experience.

- **Integration with Statistical Libraries**:
  - Use libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib` for advanced data analysis and visualization.
